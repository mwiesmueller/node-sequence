# node-sequence

A module that performs bundled javascript functions one after the other.

## Install

```
npm i node-sequence --save --save-exact
```

## Work with node-sequence

You can work with node-sequence by async/await or Promise.

```
'use strict';

const sequence = require('node-sequence');

(async () => {
  await sequence(seqDef, library, base);
})();
```

### Arguments

#### Sequence definition (seqDef):

This argument must be of type object-array. Follow properties are valid:

* method (string): Describe the called javascript method. (Example: console.log)
* await (boolean): Set it to true, if you whant to run this part as async.
* args (array): Describes the arguments to run the function in this part.

If you want to use the response from the previous part, you can define the `%RES%` placeholder in an argument. When the previous response is of type object, you can use this placeholder also in the deep. Ex: `%RES%.foo.bar`

If you want to use a base object where are handle in the complete sequence, it's possible to declare the `base` property in function call. The object is reachable via `%BASE%` placeholder in the arguments. To use this placeholder in the deep is also possible. (Ex. `%BASE%.foo.bar`)

#### Insert Library (library):

In this value it's possible to insert a complete library as argument.

Example:

```
await sequence(seqDef, require('fooBar'));
```

In this case, you must use this library with the `lib` placeholder in your definitions.

### Example:

```
'use strict';

const sequence = require('node-sequence');

const process = [
  { method: 'lib.test1', await: true, params: [ ] }, // Returns { text: { foo: 'bar' }}
  { method: 'lib.test2.output', await: false, params: [ '%RES%.text.foo' ] }, // Runs function with the argument `bar`
  { method: 'console.log', await: false, params: [ '%RES%.text.foo' ] }, // You can use plain javascript functions, too!
];

(async () => {
  await sequence(process, require('someModule'));
})();

```
